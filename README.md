# MIPS 5-Stage single-cycle CPU
# Introduction
This is a 5-Stage MIPS CPU witha fulll datapath implementation. It was developed using Xilinx Vivado on a Linux Machine. It was designed to simulate the full MIPS instruction set, and it is capable of synthesis and implementation.
# How to navigate
The best way to navigate the synthesizable code is to hit Verilog in the languages section, this will open the several functional units of the CPU, as well as the datapath and testbench code.
